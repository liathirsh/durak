# Durak (The Fool) Card Game

## What is Durak?
Durak is an Eastern European Card Game. It's played with a deck of 36 cards; the goal is to shed all cards.
Players attack and defend with cards, trying to "beat" one another, similar to the game war when a card of higher value "beats" another card.
The last player holding cards is the "durak" or "fool".
(More info here on the history of the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak#:~:text=It%20is%20Russia%27s%20most%20popular,the%20durak%20or%20%27fool%27.)

## What am I working on?
I'm trying to recreate the game using React & NextJS framework. This is written in Typescript. 
If you're an experienced developer, I'm open to feedback. 
At the moment, I'm working on getting the game set up and playable. 
CSS & Animations will be worked on after the game play logic is complete. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
